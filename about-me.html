				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>Hi, my name is Jamie and I'm <s>a recovering Slack addict ðŸ™ƒ</s> an
					experienced engineering leader with "dirty hands". As a former public sector employee, I found my
					<i>Forever Home</i> when I discovered the chaos and opportunity of startups. I like tackling "hard
					problems" with technology and doing it alongside the self-driven and mission-focused talent that
					startups tend to attract. The fluidity, pace, and passion in these environments bring out the best
					in me.
				</p>
				<p>My approach to leadership is rooted in a strong aversion to traditional hierarchy. I'm a firm
					believer in empowering teams and individuals by showering them with heaps of autonomy. When teams
					are given the freedom to explore and own their work, this fosters an environment of personal and
					professional growth that contributes to organizational success. This philosophy has been a
					cornerstone in my career, shaping my interactions with teams and influencing the culture within the
					organizations I've helped lead.</p>
				<p>When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with my wife and two spoiled pups. I'm an avid reader and
					lifelong learner who isn't happy for long with idle hands.</p>
